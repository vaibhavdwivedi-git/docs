## What is ReScan?

ReScan gives you easy access to EigenLayer data through our APIs. We built it to help devs track everything happening in the EigenLayer ecosystem - from staking positions to operator metrics.

## Why we built it

EigenLayer is changing how blockchain security works through restaking. Instead of tokens just securing one protocol, they can now secure multiple protocols at once. Think of it as making your ETH work harder for you.

But with this new model comes complexity. You need to track:

- Who's restaking with which operators
- How operators are performing
- Which AVS services are using restaked ETH
- When withdrawals and deposits happen

That's where ReScan comes in. We give you the data you need, when you need it.

## What you can do with ReScan

### Get the Data You Need
