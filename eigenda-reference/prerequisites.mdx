## API Key

To use the Rescan API, you need to obtain an API key. Follow these steps to get your API key:

1. **Login to Blockflow**:

   - Go to [Blockflow](https://app.blockflow.network) and log in with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to Project Details**:

   - After logging in, navigate to the **Project Details** page.

3. **Go to Key Management**:

   - On the Project Details page, find the **Key Management** section.

4. **Create API Key**:

   - In the Key Management section, click on the **Create API Key** button to generate a new API key.

5. **Use the API Key**:
   - Use this API key to authenticate your requests by passing it in the headers as `x-api-key`.

### Example

Here is an example of how to include the `x-api-key` in your request headers:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.blockflow.network/rest/ce08cc65-f81c-4f72-90c8-fee9c3467fca" -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```
