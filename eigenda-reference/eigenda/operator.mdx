## Note

The total number of skipped or missed batches is calculated from the time an operator joins the AVS until they exit.

### Example

If an operator joined the AVS at batchId 105 and exited at batchId 110, then rejoined again at batchId 115, the total number of processed batches will be calculated as:
`(110 - 105) + (currentBatchId - 115)`.
This formula ensures that the total batches are counted for all periods when the operator was active in the AVS.
